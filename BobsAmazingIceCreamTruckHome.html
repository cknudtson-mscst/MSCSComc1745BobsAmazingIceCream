            <p> at Bob's Amazing Ice Cream Truck, we strive to give locally and give our communities the love they deserve. We are located in the areas of Goodhue County and Rochester, MN.</p>
            <p>When you go get ice cream, let us bring you the joy of ice cream trucks you had as a kid. If you bring your kids, they can enjoy what you had as a kid as well.</p>
            <p>Bob Doe started in 1998 in Red Wing, MN. Starting off with only 1 ice truck, can now bring the joy to others with 4 more trucks. Bob wanted to ensure he could deliver ice cream to the communities he loved, so he enlisted Jennifer ?? to help bring those trucks to others around the area.</p>
